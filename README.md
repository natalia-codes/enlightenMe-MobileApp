# Creating a MOOD APP that sends information based on your inputed mood. 

## Funtionality

In this Mood Mobile App You Can :
- Create a user
- Input your mood
- Receive an inspirational quote that relates to the mood you are feeling 

## Tools Used

- Visual Studio Code 
- Python3
- Kivy
- CLI

## Preperation: 

1. Defining boundaries/specs
- Sign Up Screen: Become a user and be able to login
- A login page
- Input section to type in your mood
- quotes for moods

2. Defining key features
- Sign Up screen
- Login page 
- Input section
- Quotes

3. Finding sub features 
- Define text files that correspond to mood
- Implement text files to render on user input 
- Create a stylized logout button
- Display error message depending on invalid user credentials

4. Establishing a time-line for feature functionality 
- priorities were as follows: Login and sign up should be created first
- Create a succesful login page
- Create an input section for users to input their mood
- Create an output section for the quotes to render based on mood
- implement a style to the app

## My Experience:

I have wanted to create an app based on mood for a while now, so creating this app was a good start for me because it was simple, yet allowed me to learn a bit on user input that I hope to expand on for my larger projects. I hope that this project can inspire others to think about how they would expand on this concept for their own projects too.
